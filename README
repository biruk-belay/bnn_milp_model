This implementation includes two models 
    * milp.cpp -> The layer to be cut is not part of the optimization problem. In this implementation the LUTs are the only resources modeled.
        compile using

        For the first cut
        g++ -DFIRST_CUT -o run milp.cpp milp_top.cpp -lgurobi_g++5.2 -lgurobi_c++ -lgurobi70

        for the second cut
        g++ -DSECOND_CUT -o run milp.cpp milp_top.cpp -lgurobi_g++5.2 -lgurobi_c++ -lgurobi70

        for the full network (without cuts)
        g++ -DFULL -o run milp.cpp milp_top.cpp -lgurobi_g++5.2 -lgurobi_c++ -lgurobi70

    * milp_new.cpp -> The layer to be cut is also part of the optimization problem. In this new implementation the bram utilization is also part of the model
        
        compile using
        g++ -DFULL -o run milp_new.cpp milp_top.cpp -lgurobi_g++5.2 -lgurobi_c++ -lgurobi70
